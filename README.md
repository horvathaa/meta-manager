# meta-manager README

Meta-Manager is a Visual Studio Chrome extension (with [supplementary Google Chrome extension](https://github.com/horvathaa/chatgpt-listener)) used to organize and automatically log provenance and history-related events that happen within your code while editing. This tool is primary artifact of the CHI 2024 paper, "Meta-Manager: A Tool for Collecting and Exploring Meta Information About Code", which can be read [here](https://www.amberhorvath.com/resources/horvath_chi2024.pdf).
